## Literature Review
### Current State of Technology
Modern broadcast systems typically utilize a combination of streaming protocols (RTMP, HLS, DASH) and content delivery networks to distribute media content. Web-based streaming interfaces have become the standard, with technologies like WebRTC enabling low-latency streaming directly in browsers.

Firebase has emerged as a popular backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that provides real-time database capabilities, authentication services, and hosting solutions. React.js continues to dominate frontend development due to its component-based architecture and virtual DOM implementation that enables efficient UI updates.

### Related Work
Several commercial and open-source solutions exist in the broadcast management space:

1. **OBS Studio** - An open-source broadcasting software that focuses on video capture and streaming but lacks comprehensive administrative capabilities.

2. **Wowza Streaming Engine** - A commercial solution offering robust streaming capabilities but requiring significant technical expertise to implement and manage.

3. **YouTube Live** - Provides streaming capabilities with basic administrative controls but lacks customization options and white-labeling capabilities.

4. **IBM Video Streaming (Ustream)** - Enterprise-level streaming solution with comprehensive management features but at a high cost point.

### Technical Foundations
Nova Relay v2 builds upon several key technical concepts:

1. **Single Page Application (SPA) Architecture** - Utilizing React.js to create a responsive, client-side rendered application that minimizes server load and provides a seamless user experience.

2. **Real-time Database Synchronization** - Leveraging Firebase Realtime Database to enable instant updates across all connected clients without requiring manual refreshes.

3. **JWT-based Authentication** - Implementing secure, token-based authentication through Firebase Authentication to manage user sessions and access control.

4. **Component-based UI Design** - Employing reusable UI components to maintain consistency across the application while facilitating maintenance and updates.

### Gap Analysis
Existing solutions typically excel in either streaming capabilities or administrative functions, but rarely both. Nova Relay v2 addresses this gap by providing:

1. A dedicated administrative portal with comprehensive management capabilities
2. Real-time server status monitoring and control
3. Automated session management for enhanced security
4. Intuitive user interfaces for both administrators and viewers
5. Cost-effective implementation using cloud-based services

### Key Algorithms and Functions
The user registration process demonstrates the integration of Firebase Authentication with Firestore and Realtime Database:

```javascript
const handleRegister = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  if (!username || !password) {
    setError('Please enter both username and password');
    return;
  }
  
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    setError('');
    
    // Create user with Firebase Authentication
    const userCredential = await createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
      auth, 
      `${username}@broadcastrelay.com`, 
      password
    );
    
    // Store user data in Firestore
    const userData = {
      name: username,
      its: username,
      role: 'user',
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    await setDoc(doc(db, "users", userCredential.user.uid), userData);
    
    // Update login status in Realtime Database
    await set(ref(Realtimedb, `loggedInUsers/${username}`), {
      login_status: true,
      last_login: new Date().toISOString(),
      last_activity: new Date().toISOString(),
      name: username
    });
    
    // Auto-login by navigating to dashboard
    navigate('/dashboard');
  } catch (error) {
